## Objective
This task demonstrates how to insert, update, and delete records in a SQL table while handling `NULL` values effectively.

## Concepts Covered
- `INSERT INTO` with full and partial values

- Creating the `student` table
- Inserting 3 student records, including `NULL` values
- Updating the name for a student with `Roll_no = 24`
- Deleting a student where both `age` and `gender` are `NULL`
- Selecting all student records using `SELECT *`

## File Included
